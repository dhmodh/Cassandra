After completing all the Step from 1-3 then please start the cassandra service.

When starting Cassandra for the first time, there are several key things you need to check to ensure it is running correctly:

1. **Check Logs**:
   - Review the Cassandra logs located in the `logs` directory (e.g., `system.log`) for any errors or warnings.
   ```sh
   tail -f /var/log/cassandra/system.log

2. Verify Service Status:
    - Ensure the Cassandra service is running.
    Verify Service Status:
    ```sh
    sudo systemctl status cassandra

3. Nodetool Status:
    - Use nodetool to check the status of the nodes in the cluster.Nodetool Status:
    ```sh
    ./nodetool status

4. Check Configuration:
    - Verify that the configuration files (cassandra.yaml, jvm.options, etc.) are correctly set up and reflect the desired settings.

5. Check Ports:
    - Ensure that the necessary ports (e.g., 9042 for CQL, 7000 for intra-node communication) are open and listening.
    ```sh
    netstat -tuln | grep 9042

6. Data Directories:
    - Verify that the data directories specified in cassandra.yaml are correctly set up and have the appropriate permissions.

7. Cluster Name:
    - Ensure that the cluster_name in cassandra.yaml is correctly set and consistent across all nodes.

8. Seed Nodes:
    - Verify that the seed nodes are correctly configured in the seed_provider section of cassandra.yaml

9. Memory and CPU Usage:
    - Monitor the memory and CPU usage to ensure Cassandra is not consuming excessive resources.
    ```sh
    top

10. CQLSH Connection:
    - Test connecting to Cassandra using cqlsh to ensure it is accepting connections.
    ```sh
        cqlsh
